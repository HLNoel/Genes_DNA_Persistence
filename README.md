# Understanding the Duration and Environmental Drivers Contributing to the Persistence of Human DNA in Soil
These data were collected as part of a surface-level human decomposition study to better understand the persistence of human mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, referred to as mtDNA and nuDNA respectively.
## DNA Quantitation and Visualization 
All DNA was extracted from soil and quantified via quantitative PCR. Weekly average concentration of DNA was calculated and visualized over time. NuDNA only persisted for the first 6 weeks of the decomposition period, while mtDNA persisted the whole 11-week period. Data and code for these visualizations can be found in the files nuDNA_Quant and mtDNA_Quant. 
## DNA and Environmental Factors Influencing Persistence
Environmental data was collected during the 11-week decomposition period. This includes weekly total rainfall, weekly average humidity, weekly average temperature, weekly body moisture content, and Total Body Score. These data were analyzed using a PCA, then the dimensions of this PCA were compared to DNA quantity using an ANOVA to look for statistically significant relationships. These statistically significant relationships were visualized with linear regressions. Code and data pertaining to these visualizations can be found in the files nuDNA_Environment and mtDNA_Environment.
